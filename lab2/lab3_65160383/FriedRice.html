    <p>Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and add the eggs. Scramble the eggs until cooked through.</p>

  <h2>Tips:</h2>
  <div>
    <p>For best results, use cold or day-old rice. Freshly cooked rice will be too wet and sticky.</p>
    <p>You can use any type of cooked rice, but long-grain rice, such as jasmine or basmati, will give you the best results.</p>
    <p>Use a variety of vegetables in your fried rice. I like to use onions, carrots, peas, and mushrooms.</p>
    <p>You can add any type of protein to your fried rice, such as chicken, shrimp, or beef.</p>
    <p>Be sure to stir-fry the rice until it is heated through and evenly coated with the sauce.</p>
    <p>Serve your fried rice with your favorite toppings, such as soy sauce, hot sauce, or chopped scallions.</p>
